# Morse-Decode
## About
Designed for the visually impaired, Morse Decode is a single-player Morse code puzzle game aimed at improving one's reaction time, memory, and pattern recognition skills. The game is playable with all ranges of visual impairments including but not limited to complete blindness, macular degeneration, and glaucoma.
## Gameplay
Each round, a word is presented in Morse paired with audio beeps and flashing lights on the screen. The player must repliate the dots and dashes using the spacebar by tapping it for a dot and briefly holding it down for a dash. Advance onto the next stage by successfully replicating the entire word. A level is complete when all five of its stages have been beaten.
## Design
The design of this game was created to target the visually impaired, with a focus on glaucoma, macular degeneration, and complete blindness. The position of the flashing lights on the screen at the four corners is geared towards players with poor center vision such as those with macular degeneration, while the larger flashing light at the center of the screen is geared towards players with poor peripheral vision such as those with glaucoma. The text-to-speech feature and audio beeps are present in order to allow players with complete blindness to enjoy the game as well.
## Notes
Game was created as a part of the class Engineering 100: Gaming for the Greater Good at the University of Michigan 2019
